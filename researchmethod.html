                What is the method about?<br><br>
                
                How do you perform the method? (In detail)<br>
                • With a more then 2 examples (links if possible)<br><br>
                
                What do you need to perform this method?<br>
                • Prior knowledge? Laptop? Research document? Anything you might need<br><br>

                Make a research document for all this. With a research question, results and conclusion. (I’m expecting a deep dive in the method, so make it a couple of pages) Deliver the assignment on canvas!

            <h2>
                Context mapping in UX design is a process of understanding the user's environment and their behaviors within that environment. It involves gathering information about the user's needs, goals, and pain points, as well as their physical and social context. This can include factors such as the user's location, culture, values, and social networks.

            <h2>
                The result of context mapping typically looks like a visual representation of the insights and information gathered during the process. This may take the form of a diagram, map, or chart that highlights the key themes, patterns, and relationships that emerged during the context mapping process.<br><br>
                
                For example, a mind map may be used to visually represent the different user needs and pain points that were identified during user interviews. A journey map may be used to illustrate the different touchpoints and interactions that users have with a product or service. An affinity diagram may be used to group and categorize different pieces of information based on similarities and connections.<br><br>
                
                In addition to visual representations, the result of context mapping may also include other deliverables such as personas, user stories, or problem statements. These deliverables help summarize and communicate the insights and information gathered during the context mapping process to stakeholders and team members.<br><br>
                
                Ultimately, the result of context mapping should provide a clear understanding of user needs, pain points, and behaviors, as well as identify opportunities for improving the user experience of a product or service.
