            <h2>
                For this group portfolio assignment you will produce a Mini documentary. Mini documentaries are short videos of max. 5 minutes that show an interesting place, aspect, person, ...<br><br>
                
                • With your team, brainstorm an idea for a mini documentary (max 5 minutes!!). Some ideas to get you going:<br>
                ○ About a personality (for example someone in your team) and their skills or hobbies.<br>
                ○ About a place - Eindhoven's Strijp S, Helmond, or anything interesting that might come to mind.<br>
                ○ About an activity or artform - For example Sports, Gym and Workout, Music, Dance or Graffiti around Eindhoven.<br>
                ○ Anything about Fontys and the various activities here<br>
                ○ Whatever you might come up with! Be creative!!<br><br>
                
                • Make a rough storyboard. You can even use tools you'd normally use for App development like Adobe XD - get an overview of the scenes you'd need, the vibe you are aiming for, the music to use, ...<br><br>
                
                • Go out and film. Make use of Mobile Phones, ISSD Cameras, the Photo Studio and so on. Don't hesitate to ask your teacher for help or ressources!<br><br>
                
                • Post-Produce the video in an NLE of your choice (for example Resolve or Premiere). Add titles and transitions where they make sense, do some color grading too (use of LUTs is fine - tell me where you got it!). If you add music, make sure you have rights for the music track and list a source (ask your teacher for help if you have problems with that!).<br><br>
                
                • Deliver your final result with 1080p or 2160p resolution - MP4 or MOV with H.264 codec - Bitrate 40mbps for 4K or 10mbps for FullHD. You decide on the frame-rate yourself based on hardware, desired look and personal preference.<br><br>
                
                • Upload everything (Your Storyboard + additional concepts and information (as PDF) and the final video file (MP4 or MOV) to canvas.<br><br>
                
                • Don't forget to describe your part and tasks in your portfolio!!!

            <h2>
                On the one hand, our idea is banal, but on the other hand, it is interesting. We decided to make a video about the past. It seems to me that almost every person who moves to another country meets with similar feelings. You used to have friends, intimate and wonderful memories with them. But when you move, you don't have anyone. And you live with a feeling of emptiness. But after a while you start to go through it and you start making friends, getting new memories and life takes on colors. This is what our video is about.<br><br>

                In this project, I worked very hard, as it was my idea to show life in the past in a video. I worked on the script, on the storyboards, on the shooting, on the editing. But the guys helped me a lot too and we had a great time.

                In conclusion, I want to say that I am really satisfied with this project, as I was able to apply the knowledge that I received while working on the first project and, as for me, the result turned out to be very interesting. I was also able to better present my editing skills and even improve them.
