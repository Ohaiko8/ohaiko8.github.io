            <h2>
                For this group portfolio assignment you will produce a Mini documentary. Mini documentaries are short videos of max. 5 minutes that show an interesting place, aspect, person, ...<br><br>
                
                • With your team, brainstorm an idea for a mini documentary (max 5 minutes!!). Some ideas to get you going:<br>
                ○ About a personality (for example someone in your team) and their skills or hobbies.<br>
                ○ About a place - Eindhoven's Strijp S, Helmond, or anything interesting that might come to mind.<br>
                ○ About an activity or artform - For example Sports, Gym and Workout, Music, Dance or Graffiti around Eindhoven.<br>
                ○ Anything about Fontys and the various activities here<br>
                ○ Whatever you might come up with! Be creative!!<br><br>
                
                • Make a rough storyboard. You can even use tools you'd normally use for App development like Adobe XD - get an overview of the scenes you'd need, the vibe you are aiming for, the music to use, ...<br><br>
                
                • Go out and film. Make use of Mobile Phones, ISSD Cameras, the Photo Studio and so on. Don't hesitate to ask your teacher for help or ressources!<br><br>
                
                • Post-Produce the video in an NLE of your choice (for example Resolve or Premiere). Add titles and transitions where they make sense, do some color grading too (use of LUTs is fine - tell me where you got it!). If you add music, make sure you have rights for the music track and list a source (ask your teacher for help if you have problems with that!).<br><br>
                
                • Deliver your final result with 1080p or 2160p resolution - MP4 or MOV with H.264 codec - Bitrate 40mbps for 4K or 10mbps for FullHD. You decide on the frame-rate yourself based on hardware, desired look and personal preference.<br><br>
                
                • Upload everything (Your Storyboard + additional concepts and information (as PDF) and the final video file (MP4 or MOV) to canvas.<br><br>
                
                • Don't forget to describe your part and tasks in your portfolio!!!

                We took The Weekend's "In your eyes" clip as a prototype of our idea. This clip is dominated by a dark atmosphere and life hate theme. We reworked it to suit our capabilities and decided to try to shoot something similar.<br><br>

            <h2>
                In this project, in addition to the script, I mainly dealt with sound and editing. The fact is that initially the idea was Alexander, and for this reason he had a better idea of what we want to show the viewer, so we entrusted him with video filming. At the same time, I had never worked with sound before, so I decided to try myself in this area.  In the end, it wasn't that useful because we ended up making a music video. But I also helped with the installation, as I have experience in this area.

            <h2>
                In conclusion, I can say that this project was really interesting, and most importantly, we got a lot of experience in terms of script writing and video shooting. To be honest, we took a really difficult topic for the first time and for this reason we could not cover it 100%. That's why in the end we also decided to shoot a second video project on a slightly lighter topic and with the experience that we got after this project.You can learn more on the "Video project 2" page.
