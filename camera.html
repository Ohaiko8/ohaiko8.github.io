            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>
                So, a few weeks ago we received our first cameras. It was a Canon EOS 650D model. After reading a few articles and looking at reviews, I realized that this is an ideal option for a beginner photographer. Inexpensive, high-quality pictures, convenient control, wide functionality, and so on. Over the next few weeks, I will get to know this camera better and give my opinion.

            <h1>Review</h1>
            <h2>
                To begin with, I want to say that I am not a professional photographer, so I can only tell a subjective point of view about this wonderful camera.<br><br>
                
                Canon EOS 650D was introduced in 2012, which is more than 10 years old.  But despite this rather advanced age, she can still surprise.<br><br>
                
                Let's talk about the pros. The first plus for us as students will be the price. Due to its age, the camera costs very little money (100-150€). And believe me, this is a great option for the money to enter the world of photography. The camera is made of plastic, but despite this, it does not creak when used. In general, the assembly is very high quality. Ergonomics also pleased, very comfortable in the hands. Photos are high quality and rich. One of the really cool features is the touch screen with live view, which allows you to see what is happening in the frame, as well as adjust the focus. Also, the management of the system is faster and more convenient.<br><br>
                
                But not everything about this camera is perfect. There are a few things that I ran into while doing this project.<br><br> 
                
                First, astro photography. The camera is practically not designed for her. The maximum shutter speed that the camera represents is 30 seconds, which is absolutely not enough for a high-quality picture.<br><br>
                
                The second problem is poor-quality autofocus when shooting macro, shooting in the dark, and shooting video. It just doesn't work the way it should. Constantly moving from subject to subject and often have to turn on the manual mode to achieve a high-quality photo.<br><br>
                
                And the last and biggest problem, as for me, is the lack of a Bluetooth and WIFI module. It's just hell to wire the camera, or worse, use a card reader. Especially if your laptop does not have a slot for a memory card.
