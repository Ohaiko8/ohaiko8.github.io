            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>
                Here I worked with a very interesting Swiper library. With its help, you can create very beautiful parallax effects. The library itself was not difficult, at least for ordinary tasks, it only took me 1 day to figure it out.<br><br>
                
                As a basis, I decided to take images from the game "The Witcher 3" and distribute them into layers in Photoshop. This came in handy in the future to create a 3D effect. I also decided to make the website horizontal just for experience since I didn't know how to do it before. Well, from interesting finds, I found a script for adding Particles animation to the image.<br><br>
                
                I also wanted to insert the music from the game, but as it turned out, Chrome does not support autoplay, so I decided to abandon this idea. Asking what was the most difficult part of this task, I can highlight getting to know Swiper and fixing some bugs that occurred with the image during animation.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <h2>
                In conclusion, I will say that the task was very interesting and informative. It seems to me that with the help of such parallax effects it will be possible to create a wow effect in the future when creating websites. Of course, it won't look good on every website, but I think that gaming websites, or some kind of art-related websites, would be very suitable for this feature.
