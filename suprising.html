            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>
                I would not say that during the period of taking photos I had many photos that surprised me, since from a technical point of view I understood why they look like that. Rather, the surprise was from the perception of some of the pictures. It was a discovery for me how simple color contrast can change the perception of photos. Below are some examples of such photos.<br><br>
                
                For such shots, it is better to use one of the manual shooting modes (M, Av, Tv, or P) in order to be able to adjust the saturation and contrast of the image. By the way, I often changed these settings for other shots in the future and in this way I realized that I like to take contrast shots more.<br><br>
                
                The task also asks to describe which modes are best used for certain cases. From my little experience, it is better not to use automatic modes such as portrait mode or macro mode, as they do not allow you to adjust most of the parameters. This can adversely affect the variety and quality of the photo.<br><br>
                
                Now let's discuss the main shooting modes in my opinion.<br><br>
                
                Auto Mode: This mode is designed for beginners or when you want the camera to handle most of the settings automatically. The camera analyzes the scene and adjusts settings like aperture, shutter speed, ISO, focus, and flash as needed to produce a well-exposed image.<br><br>
                
                Program (P) Mode: In this mode, the camera selects the aperture and shutter speed automatically while allowing you to adjust other settings such as ISO, exposure compensation, and flash. It provides more control over the image while still maintaining some automation.<br><br>
                
                Aperture Priority (Av/A) Mode: This mode allows you to set the desired aperture value, while the camera selects the appropriate shutter speed for correct exposure. It is useful when you want to control the depth of field, such as when shooting portraits (wide aperture for shallow depth of field) or landscapes (small aperture for greater depth of field).<br><br>
                
                Shutter Priority (Tv/S) Mode: In this mode, you choose the desired shutter speed, and the camera adjusts the aperture for proper exposure. It is ideal for situations where you want to control the motion in your images, such as freezing fast action (high shutter speed) or capturing motion blur (slow shutter speed).<br><br>
                
                Manual (M) Mode: Manual mode provides full control over all settings, including aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and more. It requires a good understanding of exposure and allows for precise adjustments. It is commonly used by advanced photographers who want complete creative control or when shooting in challenging lighting conditions.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <h2>
                This task is clearly created for us to analyze our pictures and find something new that can be applied in future photographs. Quite a useful and interesting task, although I did not find any innovations from a technical point of view. But on the other hand, I found a lot of things from the point of view of human perception. I think it will be useful knowledge in the future.
