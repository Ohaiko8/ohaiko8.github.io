                Working on this prototype was more difficult than I expected. The fact is that before making a prototype based on wireframes, we decided to conduct several interviews to see if users like our idea. As a result, it turned out that not all of our ideas were successful. Therefore, we had to first change the structure of some pages, and only then make a prototype in Figma.<br><br>
                
                The problem was also that although we divided the work on the prototype between our team members, I had to redo quite a large part of the prototype for them from scratch due to the fact that they did not fully understand what a prototype in Figma is. Their work looked more like wireframes. There were also a lot of problems with the technical part, as they had no previous experience with Figma. But in the end, we made the first version of our prototype.<br><br>
                
                I was not completely satisfied with the result, although the client told us that she really liked it. As a result, I decided to redo the prototype again literally from scratch in order to achieve the result that I wanted to get.

            <h2>
                In conclusion, I would like to say that working on this prototype was really exciting and here we used not only the design skills, but also the research methods that we learned during this semester. We got a good experience and I really hope that next time my group will make similar prototypes better.
