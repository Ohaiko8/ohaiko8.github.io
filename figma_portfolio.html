            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>
                Work on this prototype began during the first weeks of the Media Design course. I already had experience in creating websites and therefore, of course, I could just take some of the past projects as a basis, but I decided to do something new and interesting.<br><br>
                
                It all started with a concept. I wanted to make a website that would show me as a person. I really love pandas, so I decided to build the whole next idea around them. First I created the logo, and to be fair, it took me quite a while. I had a lot of options, but in the end, I chose a minimalistic, symmetrical panda, which is located between brackets (which are usually associated with programming and the IT world).<br><br>
                
                Then the question arose of how to make a website that would reveal the idea. I began to walk around the university and analyze the work of other students. Luckily I had that opportunity as I started my training a few weeks later than the others and they were already ahead. I took some interesting ideas from them, remade them to fit my vision and made a prototype, which you can see below.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <h2>
                In conclusion, I want to say that the work on this prototype lasted quite a long time, and in addition to this, I also started my training later than others. Because of this, I could not show Portfolio A, but I think that the result is worth it. In the end, of course, I changed some ideas and added new ones, but most of the prototype remained unchanged, which I think is a good indicator.
