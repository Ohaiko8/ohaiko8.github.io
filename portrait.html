            <h2>
                • Look up some inspiring portrait photography. Add it to your portfolio (name the sources!) and outline how these inspire your work.<br>
                
                • Take many portrait photos of a willing subject (that means people) and explore how settings and focal length influence the pictures and proportions.<br>
                
                • Select your three absolute best portraits and present them in your Porfolio.<br>
                
                • Add a simple description that outlines your chosen settings and focal length for your top three and why you chose certain settings. Also give a quick description what your intention for the portrait was (making the person look cool, handsome, fashionable, dramatic, ...)<br>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>
                Well, here we come to the most difficult part. Portraits. There were really a lot of problems.<br><br>
                
                The first thing is to find a person who would be a model for a photo shoot. Luckily I have a friend Vitaly and he was happy to help in exchange for a delicious dinner.<br><br>
                
                The next problem was in finding locations. During my previous assignments, I got to know Eindhoven well and that's why I chose Strijp-S. This is quite a nice and modern area in Eindhoven. There are many locations for a photo shoot (graffiti walls, roofs of tall buildings, statues, etc.).<br><br>
                
                After waiting for a sunny day, we went there and had a photo shoot. As for me, it turned out to make a lot of beautiful and interesting shots. I experimented a lot with aperture, angles and of course the model's poses. I tried to show many different emotions through photography (Cool, Fashionable, Funny, Thoughtful). You can find all of this below.<br><br>
                
                Now for the camera settings. To begin with, I didn't use too low aperture in many shots (for example, a photo against a graffiti background), as I wanted the background to be easily seen as well, which gives the photo its atmosphere. I also tried to use a typical human viewing angle, which helped keep the proportions right, except for shots where I needed to put more emphasis on the background and not the person in the frame. ISO was minimal, and the shutter speed was fast, so that there were no artifacts and blurs in the frame.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <h2>
                In conclusion, portrait photography is a captivating art form that goes beyond capturing a likeness. It reveals the essence and personality of subjects, evoking emotions and telling stories. Through composition, lighting, and rapport with subjects, we create impactful images. Portrait photography is a powerful medium for connection, empathy, and storytelling, showing the beauty and uniqueness of individuals.
