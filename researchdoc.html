            <h2>
                Which stepping stones do you need for your project?<br>
                • Think about what research you could do to gain those stepping stones<br><br>
                
                Reflect on your research questions. Did the research you’ve done already contribute to answering your research questions? If so why or why not?<br><br>
                
                Based on your interviews, what more questions do you have now? Do you have all the answers you needed?<br>
                • Discuss with the teacher in the open space<br><br>
                
                What research can you do next (for example to complete your costumer journey(s))?<br>
                Write down at least 3 research methods (that you have not used yet) that are useful and why!<br><br>
                
                After, discuss this with your group. What differences do you see?

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>
                Since I need to develop a site that will contain information about your client as a person and also about her work, I highlighted these 6 parts the website should consist of.<br><br>
                
                • Appealing Design (colors, photos, animations, font)<br>
                • Useful, Nice-structured Information<br>
                • User-friendly Interface<br>
                • Stable Work (bugs free, optimized)<br>
                • Interaction with user (contact forms for ex)<br>
                • Presenting product in “You should get it” way<br><br>
                
                For each of them I plan to write all the steppingstones I can imagine. Of course, I don’t plan to complete all of them, because some of these steps can be not that useful while comparing to the time they take.

                In conclusion, analyzing the stepping stones in UX design can provide significant benefits for designers and the design process as a whole. By breaking down the design process into key stages, designers can gain a better understanding of the steps involved in creating a user-centered design and identify potential roadblocks or areas for improvement.<br><br>
                
                Analyzing the stepping stones can also help designers to prioritize their efforts and resources, ensuring that the design meets the needs of users and achieves the desired outcomes. Additionally, it can help designers to communicate the value and purpose of each stage to stakeholders and clients, improving the overall understanding and appreciation of the design process.<br><br>
                
                Furthermore, developing a structured approach to the design process through analyzing the stepping stones can ensure that each stage is completed thoroughly before moving on to the next one. This can help to ensure that the design is effective in achieving the desired outcomes and meets the needs of users.<br><br>
                
                Overall, analyzing the stepping stones in UX design is a valuable tool for designers and design teams, enabling them to create effective and engaging digital experiences that meet the needs of users. By following these stepping stones, designers can develop a user-centered design that is intuitive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing.
